# Classify Coherence
An attempt to classify sentences from the Penn Discourse Treebank as either coherent or incoherent. 

#### PDTB Data
Because the PDTB Data set requires a license, it is not included in this repo. In order to run the code from this project and add this data, you will need to create a top-level folder named 'data' and include the PDTB data set there. This folder is also necessary to store the output of `preprocess.py`.
